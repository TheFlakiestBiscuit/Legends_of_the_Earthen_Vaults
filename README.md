# Legends_of_the_Earthen_Vaults

*Legends of the Earthen Vaults* is a text-based fantasy dungeon crawler adventure game, operated entirely through the terminal window. Built in Java, the game emphasizes exploration, puzzle-solving, and object-oriented programming principles such as abstraction, composition, inheritance, and polymorphism.
